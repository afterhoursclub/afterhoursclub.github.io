# AHC: The After Hours Club for Electronics

![AHC logo](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/72740094)

### The After Hours Club begins once again, but this time *virtually*!

*Sensors, robots, microcontrollers, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, quadcopters, 3D printing, and much more!*

*We welcome staff and students (of any degree or discipline - undergraduate & postgraduate).*

### Semester project: How to make a Robotic Arm.

In this new “contactless” world, automation is becoming increasingly important. Robotic arms are taking on a key role.
We will explore how they work and how to make one. 

Each session will introduce a different sub-component to understand its function.
By the end of the semester we will have a fully-functioning Robotic Arm!

#### Starting Week 4: Thursday 14:00 - 15:00 (15th of October).

#### Where: Microsoft Teams Meeting (link in email).

### Further details about the club:

The club is run by us (Kostas, Kasper and Dagna), with the help of lab technicians and other academics.

We run one session per week, during semester weeks. The club is free to join and you attend whichever sessions you want to.

Some of you may have already heard about it, as it has been running for the past 7 years!

The aim of the club is to make available electronics kit, labs, and (some!) expertise so you can work on your own electronics projects.
The only rules are that it shall *not* involve University work, and that the usual safety regulations must be obeyed.

**Currently, we are restricted to virtual meetings, so we are running somewhat differently.**
Instead of helping you directly with your projects, we will be demonstrating some of our own, in streamed sessions.

Hope to see you at the club!
